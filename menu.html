        Welcome to <strong>Baseball For Bucks</strong>, a variation of Fantasy Baseball, where you take a trip down memory lane, and manage your own historical MLB team.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, how does it work?
    </p>
    <p>
        Choose a team and year from the Step 1 pane. Their general lineup will appear in the Step 2 pane. You can drag each batter to a different position in the lineup, if you think the team will do better that way.
        <br>
        Once you have chosen your winning lineup, click "Play Ball" to simulate the actual season for that team, but with your lineup.
        <br>
        Yes, the computer will simulate their entire schedule of that year, against their real opponents, just with your lineup.
        <br>
        In a few seconds, you will get a message of your record.
        <br><br>
        Currently, this site is in BETA. But once we fix all the bugs, we will move to the make-money version, where you can make lots of money with the right lineup.
        <br>
        It'll cost just $1 to play a teams, and whoever has the highest winning percentage at the end of each calendar week, will win 50% of the pot.
        <br><br>
        This is NOT illegal gambling. The only thing that's illegal about gambling is if you can't control the outcome at all, such as a slot machine.
        <br>
        But here, you have to know the game of baseball, study the team and players, and make a decision for a winning lineup.
        <br><br>
        <strong>GOOD LUCK !</strong>
    </p>
